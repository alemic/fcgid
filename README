fcgid -- flup-like fastcgi server

Are you looking for a fastcgi server which written in C/C++? this is the one for you!
I 'steal' the idea from flup, a fastcgi server which written in python. 
Now it only support multi-process model, I plan to add multi-thead model in the future.
Now it only support python WSGI spec, I plan to add support for other languages in the future.
Do you have interesting to work together with me to make it better?
